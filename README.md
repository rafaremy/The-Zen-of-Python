# The-Zen-of-Python
A poem by 'Pythoneer' Tim Peters with 19 aphorisms about Python's guiding design pricinciples.

Beautiful is better than ugly.
Explicit is better than implicit
Simple is better than complex.
Complex is better than complicated.
Flat is better than nested.
Sparse is better than dense.
Readability counts.
Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
Although practicality beats purity.
Errors should never pass silently.
Unless explicitly silenced.
In the face of ambigutity, refuse the temptation to guess.
